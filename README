Test-Mail

This module was written in 2001 to solve a problem I had at the time, and has
sat unused and unloved ever since.  Recent versions (0.04 onwards) attempt to bring 
it to a state which will actually install and run under the modern toolset.  However,
no guarantee is made as to its continued usefulness, stability, etc.  In particular
please note that the interface is subject to change in future versions.

INSTALLATION
